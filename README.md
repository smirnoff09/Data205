# Data205


### QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE CODING! I DID THE PROJECT IN JUPYTERLABS. TOWRDS THE END EVERYHTING KIND OF BROKE AND I HAD TO UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL CONDA. DOING THAT DID something AND WHEN I GOT THE CODE BACK IN AND RERAN ALL THE CELLS, SOME OF THEM  DIDN'T WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY WORKED JUST FINE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG AND I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO FIX THEM SO THE CODE YOU SEE IS THE ORIGINAL CODE AND ALL OF THE ERRORS WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT.
 
THE TEETH, THE BRAIN, AND THE SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES?

Let's hold hands and explore the relationships between our mental health, 
our dental health, and how we got here. We'll dive into statistics, graphs,
and maps and see what the story is. I don't promise any answers, but I do promise
you'll go "Hmmmm. Well thats a weird little thing".
